## Installation and Startup

### Supported platforms and prerequisites

Web3py runs fine on Windows, MacOS and Linux. Its only prerequisite is Python 3, which must be installed in advance. 

### Installing from pip

From the command line

``
python3 -m pip install --upgrade web3py
``:bash

(if python3 does not work, try with the python command instead).
This will install web3py and all its dependencies. Once installed you can start it with:

``
web3py-start apps
``:bash

This should produce an output like:

``
 _______  ____________  ____  ______  __
|  ____/ / / ____/ __ |/___ \/ __ \ \/ /
| |     / / /_  / /_/ /___/ / /_/ /\  /
| | /| / / __/ / __  //__  / ____/ / /
| |/ |/ / /___/ /_/ /___/ / / ____/ /
|___/|_/_____/_____/_____/_/ /_____/

Dashboard is at: http://127.0.0.1:8000/_dashboard
[X] loaded _dashboard     
[X] loaded _default     
Bottle v0.12.16 server starting up (using TornadoServer())...
Listening on http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Hit Ctrl-C to quit.
``

Here ``apps`` is the name of the folder where you keep your apps. If the folder does not exist, it is created. Web3py expects to find two apps in this folder: Dashboard (_dashboard) and Default (_default). If it does not find them, it installs them.

Mind that if you upgrade web3py, it will not automatically upgrade Dashboard and Default. You have to remove these apps for web3py to re-install them. This is a safety precaution, in case you made changes to those apps.

Dashboard is a web based IDE. Default is an app that does not nothing other than welcome the user. In general "apps/_default" can be an app or a symlink to your default app.

Notice that some apps - like Dashboard and Default - have a special role in web3py and therefore their actual name starts with ``_`` to avoid conflicts with apps created by you.

Once web3py is installed you can access the apps at the following urls:

``
http://localhost:8000
http://localhost:8000/_default 
http://localhost:8000/_dashboard
http://localhost:8000/{yourappname}/index
``

Notice that ONLY the default app does not need a path prefix (``/_default`` is optional).
Also the trailing ``/index`` is optional.

### Installing from source

From the command line

``
git clone https://github.com/web2py/web3py.git
cd web3py
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
``:bash

Once installed, you should start with

``
./web3py-start apps
``:bash

Notice the ``./`` ; it forces the run of the local folder's web3py and not the installed one.

### Dashboard password

Every time web3py starts, it asks for a one-time password for you to access the dashboard. This is annoying. You can avoid it by storying a password hashed in a file:

``
python3 -c "from pydal.validators import CRYPT; open('password.txt','w').write(str(CRYPT()(input('password:'))[0]))"
``:bash

and then ask web3py to re-use that password:

``
web3py-start -p password.txt apps
``:bash

### Command line options

web3py provides multiple command line options which can be listed with ``-h``.

``

                    [--ssl_cert_filename SSL_CERT_FILENAME]
